## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I now have a good grasp of semantic HTMl which is helping me write more accessible markup. 
Built more on my foundation in CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox. I understood hot to justify and align items while using both styles.
Lastly, media queries got nothing on me now.

```css
.section-pages{
    margin: 2rem 0;
    padding: 0;
    width: 72rem;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3,1fr);
    grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;    
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

More practice to deepen my understanding of all the lessons I have learned till now.
